# Phase II - Fundraising

:::tip Summary

**Phase II - Fundraising is where you start investor meetings. It’s comprised of 3 separate parts:**
- **Soon But Not Yet - to qualify investors**
- **The Switch - when you have enough momentum**
- **Signing ASAP - maximize competition to get best possible term sheet**

:::

In the second phase, fundraising, you start to actually meet with investors with the ultimate goal of signing a term sheet, which is a 1-2 page document that outlines the key terms of the financing round.

Fundraising itself can be further broken down into the following 3 parts:

- **Soon But Not Yet** - where you kick off parallel conversations with the goal of qualifying investors, which means finding out whether they are interested in leading and/or participating in your financing round.

- **The Switch** - where you either have a term sheet or are very certain you are about to get one so you change gears from discovery to making a deal.

- **Signing ASAP** - where you optimize the key terms of the deal, finalize the term sheet, and sign it.
