# Phase II - Fundraising

:::tip Summary

**Phase II - Fundraising is where you start investor meetings with the goal of signing a term sheet. It’s comprised of 3 separate parts:**
- **Soon But Not Yet - to qualify investors**
- **The Switch - when you have enough momentum**
- **Signing ASAP - maximize competition to get best possible term sheet**

:::

**In the second phase, fundraising, you start to actually meet with investors with the ultimate goal of signing a term sheet, which is a 1-2 page document that outlines the key terms of the financing round.**

Fundraising itself can be further broken down into the following 3 parts:

- **[Soon But Not Yet](/phase-ii-fundraising/soon-but-not-yet)** - where you kick off parallel conversations with the goal of qualifying investors, which means finding out whether they are interested in leading and/or participating in your financing round.

- **[The Switch](/phase-ii-fundraising/the-switch)** - where you either have a term sheet or are very certain you are about to get one so you change gears from discovery to making a deal.

- **[Signing ASAP](/phase-ii-fundraising/signing-asap)** - where you optimize the key terms of the deal, finalize the term sheet, and sign it.

You should aim to spend 3 months on this effort. There is nothing worse than a fundraising process that drags out. The investor community is small and well-networked - word will get out that you are getting turned down and fundraising will get much harder.

**The key is to develop momentum, which is mostly about parallelizing investor conversations. You want to run a tight process, in the sense that you “appear” on the fundraising stage for a limited and brief amount of time, talk to key VCs, make a deal, and then go back to building your business.**
