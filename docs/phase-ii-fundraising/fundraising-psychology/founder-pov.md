# Founder POV

:::tip Summary

**Three concepts helpful for founders are:**
- **Filter Rather Than Convince**
- **It’s a Numbers Game and You Only Need 1 Yes**
- **Don’t Take It Personally**

:::

### Filter Rather Than Convince

**There is a common misconception that your goal while pitching should be to convince investors of the promise of your idea.** While that is theoretically possible, it is quite uncommon. Instead, it is far more likely that the investors you are meeting already have formed opinions about your space / idea, based on prior investments, operating experience, and discussions with executives, entrepreneurs, and other investors. 

**That’s why the first part of fundraising, [Soon But Not Yet](/phase-ii-fundraising/soon-but-not-yet), is about “qualifying” investors.** Your goal should be to discover what investors believe and then filter out those who are not a good fit for your startup. The ones that remain have potential to be believers and you want to keep engaging them.

### It’s a Numbers Game and You Only Need 1 Yes

[Essential Investor Pre-Qualifications](/phase-i-preparation/build-pre-qualified-investor-list/essential-investor-pre-qualifications) and [Advanced Investor Pre-Qualifications](/phase-i-preparation/build-pre-qualified-investor-list/advanced-investor-pre-qualifications) describe how to pre-qualify investors. **But pre-qualification can only go so far - ultimately, the only way to know how someone will see your company is to talk to them.** Finding believers who are a good fit for you and your venture over the next decade is hard and rare. That’s why most investor conversations will go nowhere, which can be quite disheartening. 

**In those moments, it helps to remember that you only need 1.** A single investor turning into a believer by saying yes to leading your round will completely change the dynamics of your fundraise. That’s such a critical and impactful event that I have an entire section dedicated to it - [The Switch](/phase-ii-fundraising/the-switch).

### Don’t Take It Personally

As mentioned above, most conversations will be disappointing for a wide variety of reasons. It’s hard not to be affected by a lame discussion or ghosting or an obvious personality or fund mismatch. 

**Try to remain centered, calm, and confident. Put out of your mind all the naysayers or investors that ghost you - consider them filtered out. Don’t take anything they say personally or let it bother you. Instead, put your energy into the next conversation and finding a believer.**

Being able to accomplish the above is actually quite hard, which is why I have a separate section on the topic, Managing Your Psychology.
