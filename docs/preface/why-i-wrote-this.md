0.1. Why I Wrote This

There are a number of reasons why I decided to write and publish the Fundraising Lore.

First, the very process of writing things down is beneficial on its own even if nobody else reads the final text. That’s because spelling things out requires a level of thoughtfulness that is not common in verbal exchanges.

Second, having a written and easily accessible guide to fundraising will be helpful in my work as a startup advisor. My hope is that founders I work with will be able to use the Fundraising Lore as a reference about the fundraising process. This will free up more time to talk about harder issues such as fine-tuning the pitch, networking, interpreting investor behavior, and managing founder psychology. Hopefully that translates into more startups being better prepared and more successful at company-building and fundraising.

Third, publishing the Fundraising Lore is a unique opportunity to get feedback from the broader founder community. I look forward to making improvements to the methodology and adding best practices that I might have missed or was unaware of. Please reach out if you have comments, questions, or suggestions - my contact info is in 0.4. Feedback.

Last but not least, I have been the recipient of numerous acts of kinds along my entrepreneurial journey. The Fundraising Lore is one way of paying it forward. Above all, I hope that it helps entrepreneurs navigate the confusing and difficult world of early-stage VC fundraising. If the Fundraising Lore made a difference, please drop me a line. I’d really appreciate hearing from you.
