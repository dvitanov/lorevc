# Acknowledgments

The Fundraising Lore would be completely impossible without the help of numerous individuals including: 

* **Iliya Yordanov** - who introduced me to entrepreneurship 
* **Andy Rachleff** - who was my first startup teacher
* **Howard Bornstein** - who partnered with me on my second startup
* **Dror Berman** - who always believed in me 

* **Stan Markuze** - who introduced me to StartX 
* **Cameron Teitelman** - who co-founded StartX 
* **Michael Carter** - who opened my eyes about fundraising strategy 
* **Joseph Huang** - who spent many hours coaching me 

* **Chris Herndon** - who introduced me to the ECG 
* **Alex Tauber** - who started the ECG, giving me the gift of a one-of-a-kind entrepreneur support group 
* **Michal Bortnik** - who coached me about managing founder psychology 

* **Craig Sherman** - who has mentored me through the startup rollercoaster 
* **Michael Chang** - who has advised me on numerous occasions 

* **Petar Dobrev** - who has been a true partner in the past decade 

* **Last but not least, all the founders I have had the privilege of working with and learning from**

It really does “take a village” so this is but a tiny excerpt from a countless list of co-founders, teammates, entrepreneurs, mentors, advisees, executives, and investors, who have played a formative role in my life journey. For that I am eternally grateful. I aspire to pay it forward, which has been one of my largest motivations for writing the Fundraising Lore.
