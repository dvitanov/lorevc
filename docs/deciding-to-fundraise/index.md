# Deciding to Fundraise

:::tip Summary

**Maximize the probability of a successful fundraise by developing a thoughtful strategy.**

:::

Fundraising is obviously an extremely pivotal event for a young company. As a friend once remarked, for a song and a dance, you get a huge infusion of capital, which in turn can be used to put the company on a completely different trajectory. Few events carry as much weight.

And yet, as an advisor, one of my biggest surprises and frustrations is that **in many cases founders are not thoughtful about how to approach fundraising nor how it fits into a broader company strategy.**

Instead, many founders tend to be entirely reactive or opportunistic. Those are certainly essential traits to have in startupland. And you can certainly get lucky with the next investor you happen to cross paths with. 

But **luck is no substitute for strategy.** You donâ€™t want to leave something as important as fundraising to chance. **That is why I urge all founders to maximize the probability of a successful fundraise by developing a thoughtful strategy.**

In the following sections, I summarize [common pitfalls of not having a strategy](/deciding-to-fundraise/why-you-need-a-strategy) and offer a definition for the [purpose of venture capital fundraising](/deciding-to-fundraise/the-purpose-of-fundraising). I also elaborate on what makes a [company a good fit for VC](/deciding-to-fundraise/company-vc-fit) as well as spell out a number of [tactical considerations](/deciding-to-fundraise/tactical-considerations) that can help time your fundraise well.
