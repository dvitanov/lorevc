# Fundraising Seasonality

Somewhat surprisingly, early stage investing is a seasonal business. This is a fancy way of saying that VCs take a vacation and deal-making grinds to a halt in July, August as well as December. You don’t want to spend months building momentum only to have to hit pause because folks are out of the office. Planning around such seasonality helps significantly with getting the job done.
