# Fundraising Seasonality

:::tip Summary

**The primary fundraising windows are January to June and September to November.**

:::

Somewhat surprisingly, early stage investing is a seasonal business. 

This is a fancy way of saying that VCs take a vacation and deal-making slows down in July, August as well as December. You donâ€™t want to spend months building momentum only to have to hit pause because folks are out of the office. Planning around such seasonality helps significantly with getting the job done. 

The primary fundraising windows are January to June and September to November. Stick to those unless you have a good reason to make an exception.
