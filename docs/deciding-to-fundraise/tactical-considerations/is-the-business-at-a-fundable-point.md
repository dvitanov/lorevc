# Is the Business at a Fundable Point?

:::tip Summary

**Think about your startup development in terms of milestones, which serve as anchor points for fundraising.**

:::

**EvenÂ startups, which are a good fit for venture capital, are not fundable during the vast majority of their lifetime.** That is because making an effective pitch requires some sort of a special milestone, which makes it easy to effectively communicate that there is an exciting opportunity to grow the business 10x in the next 12-18 months.

**That milestone could be based on hype** - e.g. repeat founders doing something again and/or a hot space. **Or it could be based on traction** - e.g. hitting an inflection point for growth or achieving superior monetization. In practice, every pitch is a mixture of hype and traction, with early rounds typically being more heavy on the former.

Beware of basing your fundraise on a newly released feature or a recent expansion, which are yet to be proven. That creates uncertainty, which plays right into the natural desire of investors to wait to get more data. I discuss this topic further in [Reducing Downsides](/phase-i-preparation/prepare-the-company/reducing-downsides).

Getting to a fundable point is hard and rare and often the result of months of advance planning and focused work. Developing your judgement for whether the business is a at a good fundable juncture requires experience. The good news is that you can borrow from the expertise of others, which I talk about in [How to Network with Entrepreneurs](/phase-i-preparation/network-with-vc-backed-entrepreneurs/how-to-network-with-vc-backed-entrepreneurs).
