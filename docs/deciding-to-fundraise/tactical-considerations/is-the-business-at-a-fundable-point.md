# Is the Business at a Fundable Point?

EvenÂ startups, which are a good fit for venture capital, are not fundable during the vast majority of their lifetime. That is because making an effective pitch requires some sort of a special milestone, which makes it easy to effectively communicate that there is an exciting opportunity to grow the business 10x in the next 12-18 months.

That milestone could be based on hype - e.g. repeat founders doing something again and/or a hot space. Or it could be based on traction - e.g. hitting an inflection point for growth or achieving superior monetization. In practice, every pitch is a mixture of hype and traction, with early rounds typically being more heavy on the former.

Getting to a fundable point is hard and rare and often the result of months of advance planning and focused work. Developing your judgement for whether the business is a at a good fundable juncture requires experience. The good news is that you can borrow from the expertise of others, which I talk about in How to Network with Entrepreneurs.
