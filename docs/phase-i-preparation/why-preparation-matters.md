# Why Preparation Matters

:::tip Summary

Preparation is the most important part of your fundraising strategy. Don’t underestimate it.

:::

Preparation is the first phase of a proper fundraising strategy. It is designed to set you up for success in the next phase, which is the actual fundraise, where you initiate conversations with investors with the goal of eventually signing a term sheet.

**In my experience, preparation is simultaneously the most important as well as the most underestimated part of a successful fundraise.** Far more often than not, entrepreneurs don’t take the time to prepare effective fundraising materials or build out a qualified investor list or even network systematically to warm up, grow, and excite their network. 

Instead, much of this work is either not done at all or worked on while starting investor conversations. Here is a common scenario that founders end up in without preparation:

- Founders run out of investors to pitch after talking to the handful of VCs that they happen to be connected with or know personally. For the vast majority of founders, talking to 5-10 VCs is not enough. Sure, you might get lucky and get a term sheet, but what happens if you don’t?
- The most common next step is to frantically try to get more investor intros. That typically results in [unreasonable asks](/deciding-to-fundraise/why-you-need-a-strategy/) from your network such as asking founders you know superficially to make introductions to their investors. 
- Most of the time that doesn’t work because founders have to be careful who they endorse, in order to preserve the signal-to-noise ratio and their own relationships with their investors.
- Even when you get such intros, they tend to be weak (because the introducer doesn’t know you well) and untargeted (because you did not do investor due diligence in advance).
- Perhaps worst of all, these intros come sequentially rather than in parallel. This tends to prolong fundraising if not kill it outright by slowing momentum.

See [Why You Need a Strategy](/deciding-to-fundraise/why-you-need-a-strategy/) for more examples of common challenges.

As an outsider, this dynamic is ironic. As a fundraising advisor, it is very frustrating. However, to a disciplined entrepreneur - such as yourself, having made it thus far in the Fundraising Lore - this can be a huge advantage. Among a sea of mediocrity, **simply investing properly in preparation will increase your chances of raising a round significantly.**
