# Why Network?

The most important part of preparing for a fundraise is networking with entrepreneurs. It allows you to simultaneously practice your pitch, improve your investor list, and grow and prime your network so that you can hit the ground running when you start the actual fundraise. 

Please don’t make the mistake of underestimating this effort. Networking will pay off in spades.

Before I talk about how to go about networking, let’s first expand on why network in the first place. The reason becomes obvious once one considers the priorities in Phase II - Fundraising. Basically, to execute a successful fundraise, a founder has to connect with investors and pitch them with the aim of finding at least a few interested in coming on board and funding the company. 

But connecting with investors is not like connecting with other kinds of working professionals. Because investors manage capital and capital is useful for any kind of business endeavor, VCs are constantly bombarded by entrepreneurs asking them to invest. This dynamic is made worse because most founders don’t take the time to understand the asset class and determine whether they are a good fit for it as covered in [Company / VC Fit](/deciding-to-fundraise/company-vc-fit). Indeed, entrepreneurs have no incentive to do that because nowadays it is very easy to find the contact info of investors and just spam them. 

On top of that, startup investing is like looking for a needle in a haystack. It’s very hard to tell what might or might not work early on. In the beginning, all startups look kind of crappy. They really don’t have a lot going for them outside of the vision, grit, and determination of the founders. And they are usually based on a very specific insight, which can be hard to understand for a company outsider such as an early-stage investor.

What that means is that investors live in a world with a very poor signal to noise ratio. The demands on their time and attention are incredible. There is a lot of information - some of it invaluable as it can lead to investing in the next big thing, but most of it truly irrelevant - and it is incredibly hard to tell which is which. Plus, most investors are ultimately only able to invest in an exceedingly small number of companies - think 2-3-4 per year - if that! 

When you consider all these factors together, it becomes clear why people say that 50% of fundraising is the intro. How you connect with investors is half the battle because it can help your story be part of the signal rather than the noise. And that is why it makes sense to over-invest in getting the right intro. You do that by priming and expanding your network.
