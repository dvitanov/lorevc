# 10+40 Pager (Main Deck + Appendix)

:::tip Summary

**The 10+40-pager is the 10-pager with an appendix, which addresses meaningful investor objections.**

:::

The 10+40-pager is simply the 10-pager with an appendix, which is designed to address investor objections. 

The way to learn about such objections is by running your deck by as many knowledgeable and experienced people as possible, which I discuss in [Network with VC-backed Entrepreneurs](/phase-i-preparation/network-with-vc-backed-entrepreneurs). Once you do this 25-50-100 times, **you will start noticing the same few objections that keep coming up.** This should provoke two reactions from you. 

**First, on the business side, consider such questions and determine if you need to act.** It is worth noting that the fundamental job of a CEO is to exercise judgement about what matters and what does not matter. Just because others may think something matters does not automatically mean it matters. You need to examine the argument and make the final determination about its merit.

**Second, on the fundraising side, you should build an appendix slide that effectively addresses each objection you deem meaningful.** This will create a dynamic where, for each question that an investor might ask, you will be able to jump to the relevant appendix slide. That will clearly demonstrate that you have thought things through and are running a tight ship. As you can imagine, that makes for better VC pitches. 

If you get asked a question that you do not consider meaningful, you should say so in a polite but firm way. It is your company, your vision, and your judgement, so stand behind it!
