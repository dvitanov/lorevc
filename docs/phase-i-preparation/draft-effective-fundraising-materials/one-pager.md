# 1-Pager (Teaser Deck)

:::tip Summary

**The 1-pager is a summary of your company that fits on a single page, useful if investors insist on a deck prior to meeting.**

:::

As the name suggests, the 1-pager is a summary of your company that fits on a single page. That’s sometimes called a teaser deck. Note that the “single page” part is not a requirement - for example, I have seen 3-slide teaser decks.

There are 2 fundamental approaches to this document:

* Option 1 is to take the sentences from [1 Paragraph (Elevator Pitch)](one-paragraph-elevator-pitch) discussed above and blow them up into a paragraph each. 

* Option 2 is to take the [10-Pager (Main Deck)](ten-pager-main-deck) and summarize it on a single page.

Personally, I find 1-pagers a bit awkward. They are a weird in-between: a bad summary, because they tend to be too long compared to a paragraph, and a bad pitch, because they tend to be too short to tell an inspiring story compared to a 10-pager.

Nonetheless, **the 1-pager might be a useful tool in some situations such as when investors request materials before a meeting.** I discuss that further in [Common Investor Replies](/phase-ii-fundraising/soon-but-not-yet/common-investor-replies#requesting-materials-before-the-meeting).
