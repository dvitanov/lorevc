# How to Network with Entrepreneurs

Now that we have established why networking matters and why network with VC-backed entrepreneurs in particular, I want to expand on how to actually go about it.

First, some good news. In my experience, one unique characteristic of the startup ecosystem is that founders help founders. I think that’s because all entrepreneurs have been recipients of incredible kindness along their founder journeys. It just stands to reason to pay it forward - and most do. This very book is one such attempt.

That means that connecting to most founders is not very hard. You can use mutual friends, you can go to networking events, you can plug into entrepreneur communities, you can even cold call. I have seen all of these approaches work well. 

To be sure, there will be plenty of disappointments along the way, especially from founders that you are close with, who simply won’t respond or follow up. Try not to take it personally - everyone has a lot going on and their own battles to fight. I know it can be hard to see things that way, which is one reason I talk about this topic a bit more in Managing Your Psychology.

During the preparation phase, there are two fundamental topics you want to discuss with founders: your fundraising materials (discussed in Fundraising Materials) and your investor list (discussed in Investor List).

### Pitch Feedback

To kick things off, I suggest asking for 30 minutes of a founder’s time with the goal of getting their feedback on your pitch. That’s an easy ask because almost everyone loves giving advice. It makes them smart in both the superficial as well as actual sense - seeing 1,000 pitches definitely helps make your own better.

If possible, try to have meetings in person. Otherwise, offer to jump on a video call, which has quickly become much more widely accepted recently. Ultimately, your goal is to have face-to-face time, which helps build trust. 

In any case, I would try to do two things very purposefully:

* First, make sure to have a conversation rather than a one-sided monologue. You are actively looking to engage this person, not just for the potential intro in the future, but also to learn from their experience.

* Second, make sure to actively listen. You are not pitching yet - that comes later. Right now you are just looking to identify and recruit allies and learn from their experience. And that is hard to do when in pitching mode. Stay in learning mode instead.

* You should always follow up with a brief thank you note, because it’s the right thing to do when people have been kind with their time. If there was a meaningful connection, discussion, advice, then it might make sense to reach out again a few weeks later, once you have made meaningful progress on your pitch. One significant benefit to that approach is that now you have partners that are seeing the evolution of the business and the thinking behind it and are actively helping shape it. Just don’t overdo it - you want to be respectful of everyone’s time and busy schedules.

### Investor List Feedback

If the conversation has been productive, the next topic to bring up is about investors, perhaps in a second or third meeting, after demonstrating how your pitch has evolved based on prior feedback.

Before the meeting, make sure to research which investors have supported the entrepreneur along their journey and fill in some of the “essential” information in your investor list. I suggest looking not only at CrunchBase but also on LinkedIn to see which investors the founder is connected to. Definitely don’t rely on open-ended questions such as “who do you know” - because people are really quite forgetful. The more time you can save entrepreneurs by doing research beforehand, the more helpful they will tend to be.

At the meeting itself, what you are looking for is the “advanced” information - who likes what and how and all the other knowledge that is impossible to get online. Go through your investor list together and take notes as appropriate. Try to get a sense for whether this entrepreneur would be willing to do a strong intro for you in the future, or perhaps serve as a reference or a backchannel. And remember: strong introductions are more akin to endorsements. That’s the level of support you are looking for.

If the entrepreneur seems willing to offer a connection to an investor - or outright suggests one - make sure to control the timing of that intro. There is nothing worse than getting introduced too early, before you are fully prepared and ready to develop momentum, which is the key to successful fundraising. Just say thanks and that you will take them up on their offer in X days / weeks when you have your ducks in a row.
