# 1-Pager

As the name suggests, the 1-pager is a summary of your company that fits on a single page. 

There are 2 fundamental approaches to this document:

* Option 1 is to take the 3 sentences discussed above and blow them up into a paragraph each. 

* Option 2 is to take the 10-pager and summarize it on a single page.

 Personally, I find 1-pagers a bit awkward. They are a weird in-between: a bad teaser, because they tend to be too long compared to a paragraph, and a bad pitch, because they tend to be too short to tell an inspiring story compared to a 10-pager. 

Nonetheless, the 1-pager might be a useful tool in some situations such as when investors request materials before a meeting. I discuss that further in Getting Meetings.
