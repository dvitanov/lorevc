# Phase III - Closing

:::tip Summary

**In the third and final phase of fundraising, you work with investors to go from a signed term sheet to “money in the bank,” a process which is called closing.**

:::

Relative to [Phase I - Preparation](/phase-i-preparation) and [Phase II - Fundraising](/phase-ii-fundraising), closing is rather easy since you have a firm footing upon which to stand - namely, a signed term sheet. While I advise against celebrating before the actual close, founders generally breathe a sigh of relief, because the hardest part is behind them. While the round can still fall through, it is rather unlikely, especially if working with a reputable venture capital firm. 

Even so, there are a number of key priorities during closing, which typically take 2-3 months to complete. **Your most important objective should be to get everything done as quickly as possible so you can go back to building the business.**
