# Closing Overview

In the third and final phase of fundraising, you work with investors to go from a signed term sheet to “money in the bank,” a process which is called closing. There area number of logistics involved that typically take 2-3 months to complete.

While the round can still fall through, it is rather unlikely, especially if working with a reputable venture capital firm.
